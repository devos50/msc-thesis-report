\chapter{Gumby scenario file commands}
\label{appendix:gumby-scenario-commands}
As described in Chapter \ref{chapter:experiments}, a standalone Tribler runner that uses a scenario file has been created. The scenario file allows developers to specify commands at specific points in time after Tribler has booted. This Appendix describes the implemented commands and usage.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Command} & \textbf{Argument(s)} & \textbf{Description}\\ \hline
		\emph{start\_session} & - & Start a Tribler session.\\ \hline
		\emph{stop\_session} & - & Stop a running Tribler session.\\ \hline
		\emph{stop} & - & Stop the experiment and write the gathered statistics.\\ \hline
		\emph{clean\_state\_dir} & - & Clean the default state directory of Tribler.\\ \hline
		\emph{search\_torrent} & The search query and optionally the minimum number of peers required in before the search is performed. & Perform a remote torrent search.\\ \hline
		\emph{local\_search\_torrent} & The search query. & Perform a local torrent search in the database.\\ \hline
		\emph{get\_metainfo} & The infohash of the torrent to be fetched. & Fetch meta info of a specified torrent from the DHT.\\ \hline
		\emph{start\_download} & The URI of the download. & Start a download from a torrent specified by a given URI.\\ \hline
		\emph{subscribe} & The Dispersy channel identifier of the channel (can also be \emph{random}). & Subscribe to a random or specified channel.\\ \hline
