\chapter*{Abstract}
The term \emph{technical debt} has been used to described the increased cost of changing or maintaining a system due to expedient shortcuts taken during development, possibly due to budget or time constraints. The term has gained significant attention in the agile and academic community and several models have been proposed to keep track of and solve technical debt.\\\\
Tribler, a platform to share and discover content in a complete decentralized way, has accumulated a tremendous amount of technical debt over the last ten years of scientific research in the area of peer-to-peer networking.
A new simplified, flexible and component-based architecture that is ready for the next decade of research, is proposed and discussed.
We lay the foundations for this new architecture by implementing an implementation-independent RESTful API and a new graphical user interface.
Additional work includes a major refactoring of the testing framework, several modifications within the core of Tribler and improvements to the continuous integration environment to make it more usable and robust.
With the deletion of 12.581 lines, the modification of 765 lines and addition of 12.429 lines, we show that we made an improvement to important software metrics.\\\\
Our performance experiments will demonstrate that the performance of Tribler has not significantly degraded due to the invasive modifications\todo{verbeteren}.
