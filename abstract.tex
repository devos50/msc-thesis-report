\chapter*{Abstract}
The term \emph{technical debt} has been used to described the increased cost of changing or maintaining a system due to expedient shortcuts taken during development, possibly due to budget or time constraints. The term has gained significant attention in the agile and academic community and several models have been proposed to keep track of and solve technical debt.\\\\
Tribler, a platform to share and discover content in a complete decentralized way, has accumulated a tremendous amount of technical debt over the last ten years of scientific research in the area of peer-to-peer networking. We will focus on identifying technical debt and the question on how to manage and prevent it. This thesis will describe various disruptive improvements to the architecture, user interface and testing framework of Tribler. With the deletion of 12.581 lines, the modification of 765 lines and addition of 12.429 lines, we show that various important software metrics are improved.\\\\
Our performance experiments will demonstrate that the performance of Tribler has not significantly degraded due to the invasive modifications\todo{verbeteren}.
